NASA requests the following:  "When referencing the GISTEMP v4 data, please cite both this website as well our most recent scholarly publication about the analysis. In citing the website, be sure to include the date of access".

And I am very happy to do that:

- GISTEMP Team, 2023: GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP), version 4. NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Dataset accessed 20YY-09-19 at data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/.

#### Programs

The following programs support the article [2023 was the Hottest SummerÂ Ever](#)

- `giss.ipynb` is a Jupyter Note book that draws various charts concerning the 2023 record summer tempertures and how they are related to CO2 emissions.

 - `readdata.py` is a simple helper library for reading the GISS files
